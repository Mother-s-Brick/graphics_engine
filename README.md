# River Raid:
This project is an application of some Computer Graphics concepts in which you control
a helicopter that needs to leave the screen's boundaries.  
This repository is a Visual Studio project that requires the installation of `glew` and `glfw`, but it can also be
compiled without VS by linking the appropriate libraries.

# Project Structure:  
All relevant `.cpp` and `.h` files are in the `src/` directory.
